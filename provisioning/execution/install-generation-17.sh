# Generation 17: the execution-boundary corrections, deployed.
#
# WHAT THIS DEPLOYS. THREE objects, in two coherence groups:
#
#   H  helper declaration and refusal reporting.
#      helpers.py moves to declare the CORRECTED privileged action module, and
#      kyri_exec_launcher.py states the working directory of both helper
#      processes it spawns. Both are about the boundary between the coordinator
#      and the privileged helpers -- what the runtime expects of them, and what
#      it hands them when it starts one.
#
#   A  the container-runtime binding.
#      kyri_exec_podman.py states `cwd` on every process it creates. Its own
#      contract is that "every property of it is stated here rather than at a
#      call site", and cwd was the one property it inherited.
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY THESE THREE. Stage 3 for CINV-000002 returned
# unresolved twice over. The worker could not open the handoff output leaf,
# because §13 requires it to be `kyri-capability:kyri-capability 0700` and
# nothing in the tree ever transferred the ownership. And the reconciliation
# that followed could not read container state, because the operator's working
# directory is inherited across the privilege boundary while the identity is
# not -- so the dropped process stood in a directory it could no longer reach.
#
# THE OWNERSHIP TRANSFER IS NOT IN THIS GENERATION. It lives in the privileged
# action module, which is a HELPER object, moved by the separate helper ceremony
# that must run AFTER this one. What this generation carries is the runtime half:
# the declaration of the corrected helper bytes, and the two runtime-side
# process-creation sites that were inheriting a working directory.
#
# PUBLICATION ORDER IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY, AND IT IS DERIVED, NOT INHERITED.
# helpers.py is the rule that decides whether installed helper bytes are current.
# Publishing it FIRST, against the predecessor action module that is still
# installed, turns compatibility `incompatible` and supervision_ready false
# before either other object becomes observable. Every later state -- partial,
# complete, or rolling back -- is then already closed.
#
# The alternative was measured rather than assumed. With helpers.py published
# LAST, execution stays OPEN while podman and the launcher change underneath it:
# two intermediate states where a mixed runtime is executable. With helpers.py
# first: zero. `require_fail_closed_first` holds the order as a checked property.
#
# AND THE CROSS-SURFACE ORDER IS DERIVED THE SAME WAY. This generation must run
# BEFORE the helper ceremony, not after. Running the helper ceremony first would
# leave this generation's helpers.py publication REOPENING execution mid-
# transaction -- the declaration would match the already-corrected action module
# while podman and the launcher were still predecessors. Measured: helper-first
# has three states where a mixed runtime is executable; this order has none.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DEPLOY. Not the privileged action module, not
# either entrypoint, not the worker, not the quota helper, not either sudoers
# grant, not the deployment identity authorities, and not one byte of Fabric or
# Trust. Both sudoers-pinned entrypoints are byte-identical across this
# generation, so no grant changes.
#
# AND IT LEAVES THE HOST NOT READY TO EXECUTE, DELIBERATELY. helpers.py declares
# the corrected action digest while the predecessor action module is still
# installed, so helper compatibility becomes `incompatible` and
# supervision_ready false the moment the first object lands. That is the
# required intermediate state: execution stays fail-closed until the separate
# helper ceremony completes. A host reporting compatible immediately after this
# ran would contradict the deployment matrix.
#
# Usage:
#   install-generation-17.sh --verify-source      reviewed bytes only; reads no installed state
#   install-generation-17.sh --verify             is this host a Generation-16 host ready for it?
#   install-generation-17.sh --install            the transaction
#   install-generation-17.sh --verify-installed   is this host a whole Generation 17?
#   install-generation-17.sh --recover            resolve an interrupted transaction
#
# Test-only:
#   --fixture DIR   operate on a fixture tree instead of the host.

# --- the three generation-17 objects, pinned both ways ----------------------
#
# source | target | mode | operation | gen16-sha256 | gen17-sha256 | group
#
# Every target sits in a directory that already exists at Generation 16, so
# there is no directory to create and none to remove on rollback.
#
# PUBLICATION ORDER IS A SAFETY PROPERTY, NOT A LISTING CONVENIENCE.
#
# Both grants stay installed through this generation, so something could in
# principle ask to execute while the transaction is in flight. helpers.py is the
# runtime authority that decides whether the installed helper bytes are current,
# and this generation moves it to declare the CORRECTED action digest.
# Publishing it FIRST, against the predecessor action module that is still
# installed, turns compatibility `incompatible` and supervision_ready false
# before either other object becomes observable.
#
# Measured rather than argued. Simulating every publication point:
#
#   helpers.py first  -> 0 states where a mixed runtime is executable
#   helpers.py last   -> 2 such states (podman and the launcher change while
#                        execution is still open)
#
# ROLLBACK RESTORES IN REVERSE for the same reason: helpers.py goes back LAST,
# so the predecessor declaration never returns while a Generation-17 object is
# still published. `require_fail_closed_first` holds this as a checked property.
#
# THE TWO GROUPS, AND WHY THEY ARE TWO.
#
#   H  helpers.py and kyri_exec_launcher.py. Both were group H at Generation 15
#      and keep that assignment: what the runtime declares about privileged
#      bytes, and how it starts a privileged process. This generation moves both
#      members, so the group is wholly at one generation at every committed
#      state.
#
#   A  kyri_exec_podman.py, the container-runtime binding. Group A since
#      Generation 13, and it keeps that assignment too. It is a different
#      concern from the helper boundary and is NOT merged into H merely because
#      both happen to change here -- regrouping objects to make a matrix look
#      uniform would destroy the only thing the group column is for.
#
# There is no CARRYOVER in either group: every member of H and every member of A
# that exists is a row here. The CARRYOVER list below is therefore empty, and it
# is kept rather than removed so that adding one later is a visible edit.

# the count check already reads it: a list maintained in two places is a list
# that disagrees with itself, and the disagreement surfaces as a production
# refusal at the worst moment.
#
# THE ACCEPTED SET FOR AN OBJECT IS:
#
#   the ONE state it holds before this generation installs
#     -- the last ceremony accepted BEFORE Generation 17 that governs it,
#        or Generation-16 evidence when none does
#   PLUS the target of every ceremony accepted AFTER Generation 17 that governs it
#
# BOTH HELPER CEREMONIES ARE NOW "BEFORE", AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE FROM
# GENERATION 15'S COPY OF THIS LIST. G11-BB was still pending when Generation 16
# installed, so that generation had to accept both sides of it -- an object could
# legitimately be at G11-AX's target or at G11-BB's depending on whether the
# ceremony had run yet. G11-BB was accepted at G11-BB-R, before this generation,
# so for Generation 17 there is exactly ONE accepted state per object again:
# kyri_exec_transition_action.py at b11a2f19 and kyri_exec_quota.py at 54a9b15c,
# with the earlier G11-AX states now superseded and correctly refused.
#
# The AFTER list is EMPTY, and that is a claim this ceremony is making: no
# accepted ceremony is scheduled to run after Generation 17. If one is later
# planned it must be added here before this generation installs, or the host
# will report its objects as drift.
#
# Ordering matters: `accepted_library_digest` takes the LAST governing row in
# this list as the pre-install state, so G11-BB must follow G11-AX.

# The elevation gates, as they actually stand rather than as Generation 13 found

#
# THIS ONCE REQUIRED EVERY GRANT TO BE ABSENT, and at Generation 13 that was
# simply true: G3 was closed and no grant existed, so "absent" and "not
# installed by anybody" were the same statement. G11-BA then installed the
# launch and reconcile grants, and this check -- inherited unchanged -- refused
# the production host for holding exactly the grants the accepted deployment
# plan says it should hold.
#
# WHY PRESENT GRANTS ARE SAFE HERE. This generation SHUTS readiness, the way
# Generation 15 did and Generation 16 did not need to: helpers.py publishes
# first and declares the corrected action module while the predecessor is still
# installed, so compatibility goes `incompatible` the moment the first object
# lands and stays there until the separate helper ceremony completes. A grant is
# permission to ask; readiness is permission to proceed, and readiness closes.
#
# The grants themselves are untouched either way. Neither entrypoint is a row
# here, both are byte-identical across this generation, and
# `privileged_fingerprint` checks that rather than assuming it.
#
# THE CHECK IS PRECISE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE. The verify grant must still be
# absent -- nothing has ever authorised that entrypoint. The two execution
# grants may be present, and if they are they must pin the entrypoint bytes this
# host actually carries, because a grant naming bytes that are not there is a
# grant nobody reviewed. And no OTHER grant may appear under any name.
# The fail-closed-first property, checked rather than commented.
#
# Generation 16 published one object, so publication was atomic and needed no
# ordering lever. This one publishes three, and every intermediate state is a
# mixed runtime -- so the lever is back, and it is the same one Generation 15
# used: the readiness authority goes out first.
#
# Publication follows matrix order, so "helpers.py is published first" is only
# true while it is row one. A later edit that reordered the matrix would
# silently reopen the mid-transaction window this ordering exists to shut, and
# nothing else in the ceremony would notice. This refuses instead.

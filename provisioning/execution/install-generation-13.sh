# Generation 13: the coordinator learns what happened, deployed.
#
# WHAT THIS DEPLOYS. The supervised execution path ENG-0005 G11-AS through
# G11-AT built, as one transaction:
#
#   G11-AS  the execution identity becomes deployment-bound authority, and the
#           runtime gains the reader for it.
#   G11-AT  the coordinator supervises the governed worker protocol, concludes
#           a terminal result from what the worker reports, enumerates
#           executions whose supervision was lost, and refuses to call a
#           supervision path current when the helper bytes it reaches are not.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE TRANSACTION AND NOT THREE. The runtime that supervises, the
# runtime that records results, and the runtime that recovers interrupted
# executions are the same runtime. A host carrying the new supervisor with the
# old result writer would execute real workloads and record their outcomes under
# a contract that predates `succeeded`; one carrying the new worker without the
# Podman backend would fail at the moment it mattered most; one carrying
# execution without the recovery enumeration would leave orphans nothing looks
# for. Those are not degraded generations, they are unreviewed ones, so the
# journal treats all twenty-one objects as a single logical state and any
# pre-COMMITTED failure returns the host to a whole Generation 12.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DEPLOY. Not the launch helper, not the
# reconciliation helper, not either sudoers grant, and not the two deployment
# identity authorities. Each has its own ceremony and its own review; a runtime
# installer that touched them would be granting privilege as a side effect of
# packaging. They are asserted untouched on every run.
#
# INSTALLABLE IS NOT EXECUTION-READY. This generation may be installed onto a
# host whose helpers are stale and whose identity authorities are absent -- the
# runtime imports fine without them, because every one of those is read at
# execution time and refused there. What such a host cannot do is execute:
# `helpers.compatibility()` reports the supervision path incompatible, and the
# supervised preflight reports it not ready. That is the honest split, and it is
# why this installer does not demand future deployment files it does not need.
#
# THE CLOSURE IS COMPUTED, NOT ASSERTED. `tools/dev/runtime_closure.py` walks
# the import graph from the roots the installed runtime is actually entered
# through. Nothing here is whitelisted into the surface: two modules G11-AT
# added were reached only by accident of how they were imported, and both were
# fixed at the source rather than listed.
#
# USAGE
#   install-generation-13.sh --verify-source     read-only: is the PACKAGE sound?
#   install-generation-13.sh --verify            read-only: is the host at G12?
#   install-generation-13.sh --install           the transaction (root)
#   install-generation-13.sh --verify-installed  read-only: is the host at G13?
#   install-generation-13.sh --recover           finish or unwind a transaction

# The reviewed Generation-13 authority: the accepted G11-AT report commit, which
# carries every one of the twenty-one runtime objects below at exactly the bytes

# a ceremony that installed from a moving reference would install whatever
# happened to be there.

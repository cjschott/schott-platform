# Generation 15: the corrected runtime, deployed.
#
# WHAT THIS DEPLOYS. Seven objects in three coherence groups, as one
# transaction:
#
#   V  the runtime-side verification surface. The installed verification.py
#      predates 03a2e90 and CANNOT IMPORT -- it asks worker.py for WORKER_GID
#      and WORKER_UID, which that commit removed in favour of the identity
#      authority. result_content.py and contract_outcome.py are created
#      alongside it: a live capability contract names the first by path as its
#      response-content authority, and the second is the declared translation
#      between the runtime's outcome classes and a contract's failure modes.
#
#   R  supervised recovery discovery. recovery.py finds an interrupted
#      invocation from the lifecycle journal instead of from
#      CINV.adapter_identity, which the supervised path never writes; cli.py
#      opens the execution root and threads it in.
#
#   H  what the runtime declares about privileged bytes. helpers.py carries the
#      digests of the three objects the separate helper ceremony moves;
#      kyri_exec_launcher.py carries a helper's own refusal back instead of
#      discarding it.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE TRANSACTION AND NOT THREE. Each group is incoherent in halves.
# Replacing verification.py without its two modules leaves a contract naming
# absent files; creating them without it leaves a module that fails to import.
# A recovery surface that reads a root nobody passes, or a caller that passes a
# root nobody reads, is neither generation. So the journal treats all seven as
# one logical state, and any pre-COMMITTED failure returns the host to a whole
# Generation 14.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DEPLOY. Not the launch helper, not the
# reconciliation helper, not the worker, not either sudoers grant, and not the
# deployment identity authorities. Group V repairs the verification LIBRARY; it
# does not authorise the verify entrypoint, which stays ungranted.
#
# AND IT LEAVES THE HOST NOT READY TO EXECUTE, DELIBERATELY. helpers.py is the
# rule that decides whether installed helper bytes are current, and this
# generation moves it to declare the CORRECTED helper digests. The predecessor
# helpers are still installed when this finishes, so helper compatibility
# becomes `incompatible` and supervision_ready becomes false. That is the
# proven, required intermediate state: execution stays fail-closed until the
# separate three-object helper ceremony completes. A host reporting compatible
# immediately after this ran would contradict the deployment matrix.
#
# Usage:
#   install-generation-15.sh --verify-source      reviewed bytes only; reads no installed state
#   install-generation-15.sh --verify             is this host a Generation-14 host ready for it?
#   install-generation-15.sh --install            the transaction
#   install-generation-15.sh --verify-installed   is this host a whole Generation 15?
#   install-generation-15.sh --recover            resolve an interrupted transaction
#
# Test-only:
#   --fixture DIR   operate on a fixture tree instead of the host.

# --- the twenty-one generation-15 objects, pinned both ways ---------------------
#
# source | target | mode | operation | gen14-sha256 | gen15-sha256 | group
#
# Generation 14 created a package directory and its matrix carried the machinery
# for it. This one does not: every target sits in a directory that already
# exists at Generation 14, so there is no directory to create, none to remove on
# rollback, and none of that code is carried forward. Copying it would have
# meant maintaining a branch nothing takes.
#
# The GROUP column is new and is what makes coherence checkable rather than
# argued. A host must never expose one group's Generation-15 bytes beside
# another's Generation-14 bytes -- see require_group_coherence.
MATRIX=(
# PUBLICATION ORDER IS A SAFETY PROPERTY, NOT A LISTING CONVENIENCE.
#
# The launch and reconcile grants stay installed through this generation, so
# something could in principle ask to execute while the transaction is in
# flight. helpers.py is the runtime authority that decides whether the
# installed helper bytes are current, and this generation moves it to declare
# the CORRECTED digests. Publishing it FIRST, against predecessor helpers that
# are still installed, turns compatibility `incompatible` and supervision_ready
# false before any other Generation-15 object becomes observable.
#
# So execution is shut by the first rename, and every later state -- partial,
# complete, or rolling back -- is already closed. That is stronger than relying
# on no one invoking during a root ceremony.
#
# ROLLBACK RESTORES IN REVERSE for the same reason: helpers.py goes back LAST,
# so the predecessor declaration never returns while a Generation-15 object is
# still published. `require_fail_closed_first` holds this order as a checked
# property, so a later edit cannot quietly undo it.
#
# The transaction is still all-seven-or-none. Order is an additional property,
# not a relaxation of coherence.

# --- governed objects deliberately outside the execution closure -------------
#
# The closure is computed from the PRODUCTION EXECUTION roots, and the surplus
# check below refuses any matrix row that closure does not require. That check
# is right and is not widened here: these three are named, one by one, with the
# reason each is governed, and anything not named still refuses.
#
# They are NOT added to CLOSURE_ROOTS and NOT reachable from them. Making them
# reachable would mean inventing an import the runtime does not perform, which
# would be forging the evidence the closure check exists to read.
#
#   verification.py      Reached only by /usr/libexec/kyri-exec-verify-worker.py,
#                        a governed ALTERNATIVE entrypoint that is not a
#                        production execution root. It has been an installed
#                        governed object since Generation 13 and is already part
#                        of the accepted Generation-14 surface; this generation
#                        moves it because its installed bytes cannot import.
#
#   result_content.py    Named BY PATH as an authority in a live Fabric record:
#                        CCON-0001.response_shape.content.authority. A contract
#                        that names a module the deployment does not carry is a
#                        claim of enforcement no code performs.
#
#   contract_outcome.py  The declared translation between the runtime's
#                        records.OUTCOME_CLASSES and a capability contract's
#                        failure_modes. Nothing imports it yet; it exists so

#                        contract declares" is checkable rather than asserted.

# only thing this list changes is that the surplus check knows they were meant.

# The accepted digest an accepted later ceremony published for one library-root
# object, or nothing if no such ceremony declares it.
#
# Read from that ceremony's own matrix rather than restated here, for the reason
# the count check already reads it: a list maintained in two places is a list
# that disagrees with itself, and the disagreement surfaces as a production
# refusal at the worst moment.
# Every library-root object an accepted post-Generation-14 ceremony governs, as
# "<relative> <accepted-digest>" lines.
# AN OBJECT MAY BE AT EITHER SIDE OF A CEREMONY THAT RUNS AFTER THIS GENERATION.
#
# A single "current" digest cannot be right, because this check runs at two
# moments that disagree. Immediately after --install the helper surface has NOT
# moved, so kyri_exec_transition_action.py is legitimately at G11-AX's target;
# once the Phase-8 ceremony is accepted the same object is legitimately at
# G11-BB's. Both are accepted bytes and neither is drift.
#
# So the accepted set for an object is:
#
#   the ONE state it holds before this generation installs
#     -- the last ceremony accepted BEFORE Generation 15 that governs it,
#        or Generation-14 evidence when none does
#   PLUS the target of every ceremony accepted AFTER Generation 15 that governs it
#
# That is deliberately not "any digest it ever had". A pre-G11-AX state is
# superseded and still refuses, because G11-AX ran before this generation and is
# not optional. Only a ceremony that runs after this generation creates a second

# the production host for holding exactly the grants the accepted deployment
# plan says it should hold.
#
# WHY PRESENT GRANTS ARE SAFE HERE, PROVEN RATHER THAN ASSUMED. G11-BB-J drove
# the cross-surface matrix: this generation moves helpers.py, the rule that
# decides whether installed helper bytes are current, to declare the CORRECTED
# digests while the predecessor helpers are still installed. The moment it
# lands, helper compatibility is `incompatible` and supervision_ready is false,
# so the coordinator refuses before crossing the privilege boundary. A grant is
# permission to ask; readiness is permission to proceed, and readiness closes.

# be absent -- nothing has ever authorised that entrypoint. The two execution
# grants may be present, and if they are they must pin the entrypoint bytes this
# host actually carries, because a grant naming bytes that are not there is a
# grant nobody reviewed. And no OTHER grant may appear under any name.
# The fail-closed-first property, checked rather than commented.
